# 0yQc.github.io

This is the repository, where my [Github Page (https://0yQc.github.io/)](https://0yQc.github.io/) is hosted from.
The site is designed to work [online](https://0yQc.github.io/) and locally, all links are relative. The only difference is, that offline the .html endings are required, and the Home Page needs to be accessed either via [/home.html](https://0yqc.github.io/home.html) or [/index.html](https://0yqc.github.io/index.html)

## Help Me

I'm new to HTML/CSS/JS, so if you notice any errors, or have any suggestions, please contact me.
