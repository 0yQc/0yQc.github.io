<h1>Idea</h1>
<p>Change the system of autocompletion for local urls (/ or file:///) from history-based to reality-based</p>
<p>So if you're starting you're url with / or file:/// it will suggest real paths on top of the other results. And also
    make this blue finish-suggestion, which is competable with tab.</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>Most file explorers: or the linux terminal</p>
<p><li-image width="400" height="400" alt="yqc_0-1733771142981.png" align="inline" id="9345i5269DEBE9CF57A01"
        size="medium" resized="false" sourceType="new"></li-image></p>
<p>If you type some letters, for example "Doc", it will automatically suggest "Documents/" since I have this folder on
    my local filesystem. Under it there could still be suggestions like "Downloads/text.docx" or from your history.</p>
<h1>Reason</h1>
<ul>
    <li>If you're developing a website locally, you can access it's domain more easily</li>
    <li>Local files you have visited earlier, but have deleted since then, won't be suggested anymore</li>
    <li>If you rename a folder, suggestions will change to the new file</li>
</ul>
